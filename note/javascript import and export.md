## javascript import and export
[js import export](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/13959)
[ export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
> Every module can have two different types of export, named export and default export

i need a core to control all  `*.spec.js` --> (this is palywright test )
